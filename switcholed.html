  <h1>Why we want the Switch OLED</h1>

    <h2>About the Nintendo Switch</h2>
    <p>he Nintendo Switch is a video game console developed by Nintendo and released worldwide in most regions on March 3, 2017. The console itself is a tablet that can either be docked for use as a home console or used as a portable device, making it a hybrid console. Its wireless Joy-Con controllers, with standard buttons and directional analog sticks for user input, motion sensing, and tactile feedback, can attach to both sides of the console to support handheld-style play.</p>

    <h2>About the Switch OLED</h2>
    <p>The Nintendo Switch (OLED Model) is a revised model of the standard hybrid model of the Nintendo Switch. It will launch on October 8 2021. The same day as Metroid Dread. The main revision is the new 7 inch OLED screen, replacing the LCD screen.</p>

    <h2>What is OLED??</h2>
    <p>OLED stands for organic light-emitting diode. Each pixel in an OLED display is made of a material that glows when you jab it with electricity. Kind of like the heating elements in a toaster, but with less heat and better resolution. This effect is called electroluminescence, which is one of those delightful words that is big, but actually makes sense: "electro" for electricity, "lumin" for light and "escence" for, well, basically "essence."</p>

    <h2>LCD v OLED</h2>
    <p>OLED is the only technology capable of absolute blacks and extremely bright whites on a per-pixel basis. LCD definitely can't do that, and even the vaunted, beloved, dearly departed plasma couldn't do absolute blacks. Why can't LCD do that? The liquid crystal that makes an LCD an LCD only blocks the light created by its backlight. It's like putting sunglasses in front of a candle. Even the best LCDs can't completely block all the light, so in order to get those inky movie-theater-like blacks, you have to turn the backlight down (the "candle" in this analogy).</p>
